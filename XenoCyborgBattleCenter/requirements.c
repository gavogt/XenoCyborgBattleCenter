Assignment: AlienCyborg2 CLI Battle Center (Visual Studio 2022)

Objective:
Develop a modular, menu-driven C application in Visual Studio 2022 that
manages and directs strategic battle operations for your fleet of Alien
Cyborgs. Leverage advanced C practices—dynamic data structures, multi-format
I/O, plugins, threading, logging, and testing—to build a robust command center.

Requirements & Key Tasks:

Project Organization & Build System
• Use Visual Studio 2022 with a CMake project or native solution files.
• Structure your repository into src/, tests/, plugins/, and data/ folders.
• Configure CMakeSettings.json (or .vcxproj) to build the main program,
any shared libraries, and the test suite.
• Ensure that pressing Ctrl+Shift+B compiles everything and that Test
Explorer runs all unit tests.

Extending the Data Model
• Continue using enum CyborgRole and a struct AlienCyborg with role-specific stats.
• Introduce a struct BattlePlan containing:
– Unique battle ID;
– Descriptive name;
– Target coordinates or zones list;
– Priority level (Low, Medium, High);
– Roster of required roles;
– Dynamic list of assigned cyborg IDs;
– Status (Scheduled, InProgress, Won, Lost).

Fleet & Battle Management API (core module)
• In core.cpp/core.c, implement:
– init_fleet(), init_battles() to initialize dynamic arrays.
– add_cyborg() and add_battle_plan() that expand storage when needed.
– assign_cyborg_to_battle() checking role compatibility and avoiding duplicates.
– list_cyborgs() and list_battles() printing aligned columns.

Multi-Format File I/O (io module)
• Support CSV, binary, and JSON file handling, selectable via a startup flag.
• Implement load/save routines for both cyborgs and battle plans.
• On file errors (missing, corrupted, invalid JSON), log a warning and default
to empty data.

Interactive Menu & CLI Flags (main.c)
• Present menu options:
1) Register new cyborg
2) Create new battle plan
3) Assign cyborgs to battle
4) List battle plans
5) Launch battle simulation
6) Generate after-action report
7) Save & Exit
8) Exit without saving
• Parse flags: --mode, --threads, --plugins, --verbose, --help,
either via getopt or Visual Studio command-line options.

Battle Simulation & Concurrency (simulation module)
• Let the user choose a thread count before simulations.
• For each InProgress battle, spawn threads that:
– Log deployment and progress steps.
– Compute outcome probabilities using cyborg stats and battle priority.
– Update status to Won or Lost.
• Aggregate and display a summary in the main thread.

Plugin-Based Battle Extensions (plugin module)
• Define a plugin interface for .dll battle modules in plugins/.
• At startup, enumerate plugins/, LoadLibrary each DLL, and call its
init_battle_plugin() function.
• Provide a sample plugin illustrating custom battle logic.

Logging & Error Reporting (utils module)
• Create a logger supporting INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR levels, writing to
both the Output window and rotating log files.
• Use a --verbose switch to enable DEBUG logging; always capture ERRORs.
• After each allocation, I/O, or thread op, verify results and log failures.

Automated Tests & Continuous Integration
• In tests/, write unit tests for assignment logic, I/O, simulation,
and plugin loading using a C test framework integrated into Visual Studio.
• Configure Test Explorer to discover and run these tests.
• Add a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that builds
with VS2022, runs tests, and uses Valgrind or a Windows equivalent for
memory verification.

Graceful Shutdown & Cleanup
• Ensure all dynamic arrays (cyborgs, battle plans, assignments) are freed,
threads joined, and DLLs unloaded on any exit path.

Documentation
• At the top of main.c, include your name, date, and a brief summary.
• Comment public functions explaining their purpose and parameters.
• Provide a README.md detailing:
– Project overview
– Build & run steps in VS2022
– CLI flag references
– Plugin API documentation

Stretch Goals (Optional):
• Add a remote command mode via TCP sockets for live battle updates.
• Encrypt binary files with AES before saving and decrypt on load.
• Offer a simple GUI dashboard using Windows Console APIs or WinForms.
